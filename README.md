# Project Euler

In this repository, you can find my proposed solutions to Project Euler's problems. I try to make them as computationally efficient as I can. All answers are written in Python.

1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/jpconher/Project_Euler/blob/main/solutions/Multiples%20of%203%20and%205.py)
2. [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/jpconher/Project_Euler/blob/main/solutions/Even%20Fibonacci%20numbers.py)
